            <p>Hello, my name is Aly, a passionate Graphic Designer obsessed with branding and advertising. I specialise in photo editing, vector art, and illustrations, always striving to create visuals that are both meaningful and memorable. I craft clean impactful designs that leave a lasting impression. Inspired by art, galleries, and experiences, I approach design with a problems solving mindset constantly iterating, refining, and pushing boundaries. I never give up on finding the right solution, embracing trial and error to achieve the best possible outcome. I’m drawn to designing unique, immersive creative experiences, with a growing interest in UX/UI and accessible digital design. I believe that great design isn’t just about aesthetics it’s about functionality, inclusivity, and creating connections.</p>
